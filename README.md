#### 본 논문에서 MR은 CT보다 higher observed variance가 존재하여 CT보다 더 많이 실험을 진행했다.

All segmentation experiments on CT were repeated 8 times, while those on MR were repeated 14 times to compensate for a higher observed variance.

[Progressive growing of GANs for improved quality, stability, and variation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10196.pdf)

PGGAN was chosen on the basis of its training stability at large image sizes and apparent robustness to hyperparameter selection.

[Are GANs created equal?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10337.pdf)

Whether the choice of GAN architecture will affect the quality of the augmentation is unclear, however there is evidence [14] to suggest that different GAN architectures produce results which are, on average, not significantly different from each other.
