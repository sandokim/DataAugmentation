PGGAN was chosen on the basis of its training stability at large image sizes and apparent robustness to hyperparameter selection.

[Are GANs created equal?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10337.pdf)

Whether the choice of GAN architecture will affect the quality of the augmentation is unclear, however there is evidence [14] to suggest that different GAN architectures produce results which are, on average, not significantly different from each other.
